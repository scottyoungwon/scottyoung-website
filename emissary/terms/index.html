    <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
    <p class="updated">Last updated: February 25, 2026</p>

    <div class="warning">
      <p><strong>Important:</strong> EMISSARY performs automated actions on your Gmail account — including unsubscribing from senders, creating filters, and modifying labels. By using this service, you accept that these actions are irreversible and you assume full responsibility for all outcomes. Read these terms carefully before use.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>1. Acceptance of Terms</h2>
    <p>By installing or using the EMISSARY Chrome extension or any related services (collectively, the "Service"), you agree to be bound by these Terms of Service ("Terms"). If you do not agree to these Terms, do not use the Service.</p>
    <p>These Terms constitute a legally binding agreement between you and Scott Young ("EMISSARY," "we," "us," or "our"). We reserve the right to update these Terms at any time. Continued use of the Service after changes constitutes acceptance of the updated Terms.</p>

    <h2>2. Description of Service</h2>
    <p>EMISSARY is a Chrome extension that connects to your Gmail account and performs automated inbox management actions on your behalf, including:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Scanning emails to identify unwanted senders using AI classification</li>
      <li>Sending unsubscribe requests to identified junk senders</li>
      <li>Creating Gmail filters to block future emails from identified senders</li>
      <li>Monitoring new incoming emails in real time (watchdog feature)</li>
      <li>Providing a dashboard to review and manage classification results</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Authorization and Your Responsibility</h2>
    <p>When you connect your Gmail account to EMISSARY, you explicitly authorize EMISSARY to access and modify your Gmail account as described in these Terms and our <a href="../privacy/">Privacy Policy</a>. You acknowledge that:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>You are authorizing EMISSARY to act as your agent in managing your Gmail inbox</li>
      <li>All actions taken by EMISSARY are performed on your behalf and at your direction</li>
      <li>You are solely responsible for reviewing EMISSARY's actions and classification results</li>
      <li>You should regularly review the sender review dashboard to correct any misclassifications</li>
    </ul>
    <p>You can revoke EMISSARY's access to your Gmail account at any time via your <a href="https://myaccount.google.com/permissions" target="_blank">Google Account settings</a>.</p>

    <h2>4. ASSUMPTION OF RISK</h2>
    <p class="caps">YOU EXPRESSLY UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT YOUR USE OF THE SERVICE IS ENTIRELY AT YOUR OWN RISK.</p>
    <p>EMISSARY uses AI-based classification to identify unwanted email. AI classification is imperfect and will sometimes make errors. By using the Service, you acknowledge and accept that:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>EMISSARY may incorrectly classify legitimate, important, or wanted emails as junk</li>
      <li>EMISSARY may send unsubscribe requests to senders you did not intend to unsubscribe from</li>
      <li>EMISSARY may create Gmail filters that block emails you wanted to receive</li>
      <li>Unsubscribe actions and Gmail filter creation may be difficult or impossible to reverse</li>
      <li>You may miss emails, notices, confirmations, or other communications as a result of EMISSARY's actions</li>
      <li>EMISSARY's watchdog feature operates autonomously and may take actions without real-time notice to you</li>
    </ul>
    <p>You are responsible for regularly reviewing EMISSARY's actions and correcting any errors through the sender review dashboard.</p>

    <h2>5. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES</h2>
    <p class="caps">THE SERVICE IS PROVIDED "AS IS" AND "AS AVAILABLE," WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED.</p>
    <p class="caps">TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, EMISSARY EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO: (A) IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT; (B) ANY WARRANTY THAT THE SERVICE WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED, ERROR-FREE, SECURE, OR FREE OF VIRUSES OR OTHER HARMFUL COMPONENTS; (C) ANY WARRANTY REGARDING THE ACCURACY, RELIABILITY, OR COMPLETENESS OF AI CLASSIFICATION RESULTS; AND (D) ANY WARRANTY THAT THE SERVICE WILL MEET YOUR REQUIREMENTS OR EXPECTATIONS.</p>
    <p>We do not warrant that EMISSARY will correctly identify all unwanted email, or that it will never misclassify wanted email as junk.</p>

    <h2>6. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY</h2>
    <p class="caps">TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT SHALL EMISSARY, ITS OPERATORS, EMPLOYEES, AGENTS, OR AFFILIATES BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO:</p>
    <ul>
      <li class="caps">LOSS OF PROFITS, REVENUE, DATA, GOODWILL, OR OTHER INTANGIBLE LOSSES</li>
      <li class="caps">MISSED EMAILS, NOTICES, DEADLINES, APPOINTMENTS, OR COMMUNICATIONS OF ANY KIND</li>
      <li class="caps">UNINTENDED UNSUBSCRIPTIONS FROM MAILING LISTS, SERVICES, OR COMMUNICATIONS</li>
      <li class="caps">GMAIL FILTERS THAT BLOCK WANTED OR IMPORTANT EMAILS</li>
      <li class="caps">ANY DAMAGES ARISING FROM INCORRECT AI CLASSIFICATION RESULTS</li>
      <li class="caps">ANY DAMAGES ARISING FROM UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS TO YOUR ACCOUNT BY THIRD PARTIES</li>
      <li class="caps">ANY OTHER MATTER RELATING TO THE SERVICE</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="caps">IN NO EVENT SHALL OUR TOTAL AGGREGATE LIABILITY TO YOU FOR ALL CLAIMS ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THE SERVICE EXCEED THE GREATER OF: (A) THE TOTAL AMOUNT YOU PAID TO US IN THE THREE (3) MONTHS IMMEDIATELY PRECEDING THE CLAIM, OR (B) TEN DOLLARS ($10.00 USD).</p>
    <p class="caps">SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF CERTAIN WARRANTIES OR LIMITATION OF LIABILITY FOR CONSEQUENTIAL OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES. IN SUCH JURISDICTIONS, OUR LIABILITY IS LIMITED TO THE GREATEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW.</p>

    <h2>7. Indemnification</h2>
    <p>You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless EMISSARY and its operators, employees, agents, and affiliates from and against any claims, liabilities, damages, losses, and expenses (including reasonable legal fees) arising out of or in any way connected with: (a) your use of the Service; (b) your violation of these Terms; (c) any actions EMISSARY takes on your Gmail account at your direction; or (d) your violation of any third-party rights.</p>

    <h2>8. Subscription and Billing</h2>

    <p><strong>a) Plans and Pricing.</strong> EMISSARY offers a free initial inbox scan and paid subscription plans for ongoing inbox monitoring. Current pricing is listed at <a href="https://scottyoung.co/emissary">scottyoung.co/emissary</a>. We reserve the right to change pricing with 30 days' notice — existing subscribers keep their current rate until the end of their billing cycle.</p>

    <p><strong>b) Payment Processing.</strong> All payments are processed by Stripe, Inc. ("Stripe"). By subscribing, you also agree to <a href="https://stripe.com/legal/ssa" target="_blank">Stripe's Services Agreement</a>. We do not store or have access to your full payment card details.</p>

    <p><strong>c) Recurring Billing.</strong> By subscribing, you authorize recurring monthly charges to your payment method at the rate in effect at the time of each renewal. Each billing cycle begins on the date of your initial subscription and renews on the same date each month.</p>

    <p><strong>d) Cancellation.</strong> You may cancel your subscription at any time. Upon cancellation, you retain access to paid features until the end of your current billing period. No further charges will be made after cancellation.</p>

    <p><strong>e) Refunds.</strong> Payments are generally non-refundable. However, if you are dissatisfied with the Service, you may request a full refund within 7 days of your first subscription payment by emailing <a href="mailto:privacy@scottyoung.co">privacy@scottyoung.co</a>. Refunds are issued to the original payment method within 5–10 business days. No refunds are available after the 7-day window or on renewal payments.</p>

    <p><strong>f) Payment Failure.</strong> If a scheduled payment fails, our payment processor will attempt to process the charge again over the following days. If all payment attempts fail, your subscription will be paused and paid features will be disabled until a valid payment method is provided. Your data and settings are retained for 90 days after a payment failure.</p>

    <p><strong>g) Price Changes.</strong> We may adjust subscription pricing with at least 30 days' notice. If you do not agree to a price change, you may cancel before it takes effect. Continued use of the Service after a price change takes effect constitutes acceptance of the new pricing.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Use the Service for any unlawful purpose or in violation of any applicable law or regulation</li>

    </ul>

You waive any right to participate in a class action lawsuit or class-wide arbitration against EMISSARY.</p>

    <h2>13. Severability</h2>
