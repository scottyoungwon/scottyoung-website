    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p class="updated">Last updated: February 24, 2026</p>

    <div class="highlight">
      <p><strong>Short version:</strong> EMISSARY reads only sender names and email subject lines. We never read, store, or share the content of your emails. We never sell your data. Ever.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Who we are</h2>
    <p>EMISSARY is operated by Scott Young ("we," "us," or "our"). By using EMISSARY, you agree to this Privacy Policy and our <a href="../terms/">Terms of Service</a>.</p>

    <h2>What EMISSARY does</h2>
    <p>EMISSARY is a Chrome extension that helps you unsubscribe from unwanted email senders and block future junk from reaching your inbox. It uses AI classification to identify marketing emails, newsletters, and spam based on sender information and subject lines only.</p>

    <h2>What data we access</h2>
    <p>To provide the service, EMISSARY accesses your Gmail account via the Gmail API. Specifically, we read:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Sender email address</strong> — to identify and classify who is sending you email</li>
      <li><strong>Email subject line</strong> — to assist with classification accuracy</li>
      <li><strong>List-Unsubscribe headers</strong> — to execute unsubscribe requests on your behalf</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We also use the Gmail API to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Send unsubscribe requests (mailto: unsubscribe) on your behalf</li>
      <li>Create Gmail filters to block future junk senders</li>
      <li>Modify email labels when processing messages</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>What data we do NOT access</h2>
    <p>EMISSARY never reads, stores, transmits, or processes:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The body or content of your emails</li>
      <li>Email attachments</li>
      <li>Your contacts or address book</li>
      <li>Any email metadata beyond sender address and subject line</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How we use your data</h2>
    <p>Sender addresses and subject lines are used solely to classify email as junk, legitimate, or uncertain. Classification is performed by an AI model (Anthropic Claude API). Only sender address and subject line are sent to the AI — never full email content.</p>
    <p>Classification results are stored in a secure database associated with your Gmail address so that previously seen senders are not re-classified (reducing costs and improving speed).</p>
    <p>We do not use your data for advertising, marketing profiling, or any purpose beyond operating the core email management service.</p>

    <h2>Data storage</h2>
    <p>We store the following in our secure cloud database (Google Firestore, hosted in the United States):</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Your Gmail address (to associate your data)</li>
      <li>Sender email addresses and their classifications (junk/keep)</li>
      <li>Timestamps of when senders were classified</li>
      <li>Watchdog configuration (on/off state)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We do not store email subjects, email bodies, or any other email content in our database.</p>
    <p><strong>Retention:</strong> Your data is retained until you request deletion or your account has been inactive for 24 consecutive months, whichever comes first.</p>

    <h2>Cookies and tracking</h2>
    <p>EMISSARY does not use cookies, tracking pixels, or any analytics or advertising technology on this website or in the extension.</p>

    <h2>Data sharing</h2>
    <p>We do not sell, rent, or share your personal data with any third parties for advertising, marketing, or any other commercial purpose.</p>
    <p>The only third-party service that receives any data is Anthropic (Claude AI API), which receives sender address and subject line only for classification purposes. Anthropic's privacy policy is available at <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/privacy" target="_blank">anthropic.com/privacy</a>.</p>

    <h2>Google API compliance</h2>
    <p>EMISSARY's use and transfer of information received from Google APIs adheres to the <a href="https://developers.google.com/terms/api-services-user-data-policy" target="_blank">Google API Services User Data Policy</a>, including the Limited Use requirements. Specifically:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>We only use Gmail data to provide and improve EMISSARY's email management features</li>
      <li>We do not use Gmail data to develop, improve, or train generalized AI or ML models</li>
      <li>We do not allow humans to read your Gmail data unless you have given explicit permission, it is necessary for security purposes, or we are required to do so by law</li>
      <li>We do not use or transfer Gmail data for serving advertisements</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>International data transfers</h2>
    <p>EMISSARY is operated from the United States. Data stored in Google Firestore is located in the United States (us-east1 region). If you are located outside the United States, your data will be transferred to and processed in the United States. By using EMISSARY, you consent to this transfer.</p>

    <h2>Your rights</h2>
    <p><strong>All users:</strong> You can revoke EMISSARY's access to your Gmail account at any time via your <a href="https://myaccount.google.com/permissions" target="_blank">Google Account settings</a>. You can request deletion of all stored data by emailing <a href="mailto:privacy@scottyoung.co">privacy@scottyoung.co</a>. We will delete all data associated with your Gmail address within 7 days.</p>
    <p><strong>EU/EEA residents (GDPR):</strong> You have the right to access, rectify, erase, restrict processing of, and port your personal data. You also have the right to object to processing and to lodge a complaint with your local data protection authority. To exercise any of these rights, contact us at <a href="mailto:privacy@scottyoung.co">privacy@scottyoung.co</a>.</p>
    <p><strong>California residents (CCPA):</strong> You have the right to know what personal information we collect, to request deletion of your personal information, and to opt out of the sale of personal information. We do not sell personal information. To exercise your rights, contact us at <a href="mailto:privacy@scottyoung.co">privacy@scottyoung.co</a>.</p>

    <h2>Data deletion</h2>
    <p>You can request deletion of all your data at any time by emailing <a href="mailto:privacy@scottyoung.co">privacy@scottyoung.co</a>. We will delete all stored data associated with your Gmail address within 7 days of your request.</p>
    <p>Uninstalling the Chrome extension stops all active data processing. It does not automatically delete previously stored data — please contact us if you want your stored data removed.</p>

    <h2>Security</h2>
    <p>All data is transmitted over HTTPS. Access to your Gmail account requires explicit OAuth authorization, which you can revoke at any time via your <a href="https://myaccount.google.com/permissions" target="_blank">Google Account settings</a>. We use industry-standard security practices for all stored data.</p>

    <h2>Children's privacy</h2>
    <p>EMISSARY is not intended for use by children under 13. We do not knowingly collect data from children under 13. If we become aware that a child under 13 has provided us with personal data, we will delete it immediately.</p>

    <h2>Changes to this policy</h2>
    <p>If we make material changes to this privacy policy, we will update the date at the top of this page. Continued use of the extension after changes constitutes acceptance of the updated policy.</p>

    <h2>Contact</h2>
    <p>Questions about this privacy policy or your data? Email us at <a href="mailto:privacy@scottyoung.co">privacy@scottyoung.co</a>.</p>
